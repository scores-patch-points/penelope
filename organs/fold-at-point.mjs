// organs/fold-at-point.mjs — the universe folded at a point (2026-10-01).
//
// Identity is the universe folded at a point, bounded by differences that make
// a difference, for a particular for-whom. An essay IS such a fold: the same
// universe (the clean sources) folds differently at different for-whoms, and
// the fold's identity is the consequence it makes there. This organ is the
// ETHOS: it selects, from the universe, the claims whose differences make a
// difference TO the for-whom — the load-bearing threads of the fold.
//
// The box selects by the for-whom's stake (its significant words, plus each
// section's aspect); a clean sentence that shares the stake is a load-bearing
// difference; the rest of the universe stays outside the fold. Two for-whoms →
// two stakes → two selections → two identities, by consequence.
//
// STANCE, INJECTED (2026-10-02, GL-RR-10). Word-overlap selection has a named
// weakness: a sentence can share the stake's words and still be OFF the being
// the stake names (the shuffled control — act words on the wrong referent).
// So the fold carries, per selected claim, the STANCE verdict when the caller
// injects the stance organ (eoreader7/native/organs/stance.js — the cast.js
// pattern, organs injected): readStance(claim, holon) → in_terms / against /
// off_being at the level. The verdict is a FACT about the claim relative to
// the source it came from, carried beside the byte address — never used to
// drop a claim (the fold's selection stays the difference-making), only to
// disclose what the selected claim IS to the material it stands on. Omitted,
// the fold is byte-identical to before (no stance field).
//
// PURE (node builtins + injected organs). Selftest:
//   node --input-type=module -e "import('./organs/fold-at-point.mjs').then(m=>m.selftest())"
